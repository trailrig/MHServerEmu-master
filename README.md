# MHServerEmu

MHServerEmu is an experimental server emulator for Marvel Heroes.

The only currently supported version of the game client is **1.52.0.1700** (also known as **2.16a**).

We post development progress reports on our [blog](https://crypto137.github.io/MHServerEmu/). You can find additional information on various topics in the [documentation](./docs/Index.md). If you would like to discuss this project and/or help with its development, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hjR8Bj52t3).

## Features

MHServerEmu is in early stages of development. Currently it features:

- Complete network protocol implementation.

- Account system with simple web API for registering new accounts.

- Basic multiplayer functionality: handling multiple clients, remote connections, chat.

- Exploration of all hubs, as well as a number of public combat zones and private instances.

- In-game hero and costume selection.

- Rudimentary implementation of hero powers.

- Early implementation of NPCs and interactable objects in some static regions.

## Setup

See [Initial Setup](./docs/Setup/InitialSetup.md) for information on how to set the server up. Please note that since MHServerEmu is still in early stages in development, the process is currently not particularly user friendly.
