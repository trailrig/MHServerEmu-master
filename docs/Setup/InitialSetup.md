# Initial Setup

First you need to get the 1.52.0.1700 client. This is the final released version of Marvel Heroes, If you still have the game in your Steam library, you can download it from there.

*Note: it is also possible to download other versions of the client from Steam. See [Client Versions](./../Client/ClientVersions.md) for details.*

After getting the client, you need to set up a web server to serve SiteConfig.xml and redirect login requests. For this guide we're going to use Apache.

1. Download Apache 2.4.58 Win64 [here](https://www.apachelounge.com/download/). You can use any other version of Apache you prefer, as long as it has OpenSSL support enabled.

2. Extract the ```Apache24``` folder in the archive to the root directory on any drive (e.g. ```C:\Apache24```).

3. Open `Apache24\conf\httpd.conf` with any text editor and uncomment (by removing the # symbol) the following six lines: `LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so`, `LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so`,  `LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so`, `Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf` `LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so`, and `LoadModule socache_shmcb_module modules/mod_socache_shmcb.so`. Make sure you remove only the # symbol and not the entire line!

4. Open ```Apache24\conf\extra\httpd-ssl.conf``` with any text editor, find the `<VirtualHost _default_:443>` section, and add the following two lines to it:
   `RewriteEngine on` and `RewriteRule ^/AuthServer(.*) http://%{HTTP_HOST}:8080$1 [P]`.

5. Put [server.crt](./../../assets/ssl/server.crt) and [server.crt](./../../assets/ssl/server.key) provided in this repository in `Apache24\conf`. Alternatively, you can generate your own OpenSSL certificate.

6. Put [SiteConfig.xml](./../../assets/SiteConfig.xml) provided in this repository in ```Apache24\htdocs```.

7. Open ```ClientConfig.xml``` located in ```Marvel Heroes\Data\Configs``` with any text editor and replace the ```SiteConfigLocation``` value with ```localhost/SiteConfig.xml```. The line should look like this: `<str name="SiteConfigLocation" value="localhost/SiteConfig.xml" />`.

8. Build MHServerEmu with Visual Studio or any other tool you prefer. You can download Visual Studio Community [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). If this is your first time building a .NET project, you can find instructions for Visual Studio [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/building-and-cleaning-projects-and-solutions-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2022).

9. Copy `Calligraphy.sip` and `mu_cdata.sip` located in `Marvel Heroes\Data\Game` to `MHServerEmu\Assets\GPAK`. Make sure to copy these files to where your compiled emulator is (e.g. `src\MHServerEmu\bin\x64\Debug\net6.0\Assets\GPAK`), and not to one of the source directories.

Now you can actually start everything and get in-game.

1. Start Apache by running ```Apache24\bin\httpd.exe```.

2. Start MHServerEmu.

3. Launch the game.

4. Log in with any email and password.

If everything works correctly, the server should display client connection information.

*Note: you can launch the game without Steam by running MarvelHeroesOmega.exe with the following arguments: -robocopy -nosteam.*

You can customize how the emulator functions by editing the `Config.ini` file. See [Advanced Setup](./AdvancedSetup.md) for more advanced setup topics.
